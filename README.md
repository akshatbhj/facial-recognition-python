# Facial Recognition Project Readme

## Overview

This project is a Python-based facial recognition system using the OpenCV and face-recognition libraries. The goal of this project is to recognize and identify faces from a set of images stored in a folder. This README file will guide you through the setup and usage of the project.

## Installation

Before using this project, you need to set up your Python environment and install the required libraries. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshatbhj/facial-recognition-python.git
   cd facial-recognition-python
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

   It's good practice to work in a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`:

   ```bash
   # Install virtualenv if you haven't already
   pip install virtualenv

   # Create a virtual environment
   virtualenv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment (on Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`)
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use `pip` to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install numpy
   pip install face-recognition
   ```

## Usage

Now that you have set up your environment, you can use the facial recognition system to recognize faces from a folder of images.

1. **Prepare the Image Dataset:**

   Place the images you want to recognize in a folder, for example, `known_faces`. Make sure the images are of good quality and contain the faces you want to recognize.

2. **Run the Facial Recognition Script:**

   Run the main facial recognition script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will process the images in the specified folder, detect faces, and attempt to recognize them based on the known faces in your dataset.

3. **View the Results:**

   The recognized faces will be displayed, and the recognized names (if available) will be shown alongside the faces.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
facial-recognition-project/
│
├── main.py                # Main script for facial recognition
├── known_faces/           # Folder containing known faces (reference images)
│   ├── person1.jpg
│   ├── person2.jpg
│   └── ...
└── README.md              # This README file
```
